<h2>What is a cognitive task?</h2>
<p>
	An elementary cognitive task (ECT) is any of
	a range of basic tasks which require
	only a small number of mental processes
	and which have easily specified correct outcomes.
</p><p>
	Although ECTs may be cognitively simple,
	there is evidence that performance on such tasks
	correlates well with other measures
	of general intelligence, such as Raven's
	Progressive Matrices.
</p><p>
	For example, correcting for attenuation,
	the correlation between IQ test scores and
	ECT performance is about 0.5.
</p><br/><p>
	The term was proposed by John Bissell Carroll in 1980,
	who posited that all test performance could be analyzed
	and broken down to building blocks called ECTs.
</p><p>
	Test batteries such as Microtox were developed
	based on this theory and have shown utility
	in the evaluation of test subjects under the influence
	of carbon monoxide or alcohol.
