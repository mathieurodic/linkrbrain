		LinkRbrain is an <b>online tool</b> intended to manipulate neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and neurogenetic data.
		Various operations can be performed in a few clicks, directly from our query page:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Visualize</b>:
				map your data on a 2- or 3-D representation of the human brain</li>
			<li><b>Compare</b>:
				compare your data with our presets, and view the correlations with cognitive tasks and gene expressions
				in the form of a table or a graph</li>
			<li><b>Save &amp; load</b>:
				use your account to manage your results and keep them available everywhere you go</li>
			<li><b>Export</b>:
				download your results as a PDF file</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The input data may come in <b>various types</b>:
		<ul style="color:#E70">
			<li><b>Neuroimaging</b>:
				you can import neuroimaging files in the NIfTI format</li>
			<li><b>Coordinates</b>:
				write a list of MNI coordinates or import a text file containing such a list</li>
			<li><b>Presets</b>:
				use presets from our database! It contains about 21,000 entries on gene expression mapping
				and 300 activation patterns corresponding to well-established cognitive tasks.</li>
		</ul>

		Depending on your domain, LinkRbrain can help you in many ways:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Neurology & psychiatry</b>:
				display your neuroimaging data, visualize altered patterns, link them with the corresponding cognitive tasks
				</li>
			<li><b>Neuroscience</b>:
				display your data, compare populations, correlate them with cognitive tasks or gene expression,
				test hypothesis
				</li>
			<li><b>Cognition</b>:
				connect cognitive tasks with each other, test hypothesis
				</li>
		</ul>

	<dt class="why"><a href="#why" name="why">Why this project?</a></dt>
	<dd class="why">
		For our research, we needed a tool to <b>analyze neuroscientific data</b> in a <b>fast and easy</b> way.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		We wanted a <b>platform</b> which would allow us to quickly
		display our results, compare groups, correlate them with known cognitive tasks
		and genes surexpression, and keep a track of our work.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		We then decided to build such a plateform.
		It is <b>now available</b> to the scientific community!

	<dt class="where"><a href="#where" name="where">Where do the data come from?</a></dt>
	<dd class="where">
		We mainly used two sources for our database:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Genetic expressions</b>
				for one humain brain, provided by the
				<a href="http://www.alleninstitute.org/science/public_resources/atlases/human_atlas.html">Allen Institute for Brain Science</a>
				</li>
			<li>Peaks of activation for <b>310 cognitive concepts</b>
				extracted from
				<a href="http://neurosynth.org/">NeuroSynth</a>
				(using 5809 articles) and
				labeled by the text-mining tool
				<a href="http://www.cortext.net">CorTexT</a>
